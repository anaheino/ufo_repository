# ufo_repository
Containing all the ufo stuff.

Initial plan is:

# ufo_scraper

- contains web-scraper implemented in Rust for parsing sightings to mongoDB

# ufo_backend

- contains REST-service that uses MongoDb mentioned above, and allows querying

# ufo_frontend

- contains frontend that has a map and communicates with ufo_backend
